# **GODOG**



## **GAME CONCEPT**


Our game is a platform game where the dog has to reach the end of the map and bark to complete the level. It must overcome traps to reach the end and collect bones that will increase its speed (making the game more challenging and difficult to control). The dog will have a button assigned to the poop animation, which we will use as a checkpoint. Each time the dog dies, it will restart at the beginning of the level, except when using this animation, in which case it will restart from the last checkpoint.


## **INTERFACES**


The game will have a main screen where you can choose between play, exit, and controls, and a final screen when the game is finished. It will also have a death counter.


## **MECHANICS**

Godog will walk and jump using buttons.


○ Godog can run using a button and use it to perform a long jump.


○ Godog sits down when standing still and can even sit up.


○ Godog poops to reach a checkpoint.


○ Godog barks to finish the level.


## **ASSETS**

○ We will use the provided folder to create the dog's animations and for the game logo, loading screen, and game icon.


○ We will add music and sounds to the game, including ambient music and sounds for when Godog jumps and picks up a bone.


## **FUTURE UPDATES**


○ New levels and a health bar for Godog may be added in future updates.
